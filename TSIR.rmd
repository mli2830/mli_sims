## Problem

I am trying to figure out why the hybrid TSIR chain binomial is overshooting the estimates (See [poster](https://github.com/wzmli/lunchbox/blob/master/EEID_Final_Mike.pdf). If it doesn't work, just refresh the page.). To simplify the problem more, let's keep it simple and not **hybridize**, only use the binomial distribution for both processes, and use **Jags** for now.


## Discrete Latent State TSIR Chain Binomial

### Model

The Reed-Frost model is a discrete-time SIR model that assumes recovery one time step after infection. Let $N$ be the population size, $I_{1}$ be the initial number of infectives, $\beta$ be the probability of adequate contact per infective, then the RF model can be written as:

$$
S_{1} = N - I_{1}
\\
I_{t} \sim \textrm{Binomial}(\textrm{prob} = 1-(1-\beta)^{I_{t-1}} , \textrm{size}=S_{t-1})
\\
S_{t} = S_{t-1} - I_{t}
$$

We modified the RF model as a _latent_ binomial process and added an observation process with reporting probability $r$ and assumed $N_{e}$ is an effective population with an effective proportion $\alpha$ of the upper limit population size _N_. The modified RF model can be written as:

$$
N_{e} \sim \textrm{Binomial}(\textrm{prob} = \alpha, \textrm{size}=N)
\\
S_{1} = N_{e} - I_{1}
\\
I_{t} \sim \textrm{Binomial}(\textrm{prob} = 1-(1-\beta)^{I_{t-1}} , \textrm{size}=S_{t-1})
\\
Obs_{t} \sim \textrm{Binomial}(\textrm{prob}=r,\textrm{size}=I_{t})
\\
S_{t} = S_{t-1} - I_{t}
$$

## Jags Results 
Using the same parameters as the models in the poster, here are the plots/chains for the discrete latent state chain binomial. _Note_ I used stronger priors for the poster and uninformative priors (Beta(1,1)) for _effprop_ and _repMean_. I also used the _true_ parameters as the initial starting point to see if we can even estimate the parameters given we have a good starting point.

###Parameters
- $R_{0} = 2$
- $\beta = 0.7 $ (effective proportion of population)
- $ r = 0.4 $ , (reporting mean/probability) 

```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(R2jags)
load("./lunchbox/.dis.jags.B.B.fit.RData")
JagsDiscrete
plot(JagsDiscrete)
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
traceplot(JagsDiscrete)
```

The mixing are pretty bad for $repMean$.

## Broad Questions
- Can hybrid + HMC _really_ handle correlated parameters?
- Is this a problem of unidentifiability/ weak unidentifiability?

## Instructions to reproduce the plots above
- **clone/pull** the latest version of [lunchbox](https://github.com/wzmli/lunchbox)
- type **make** (the first time will clone JD's makestuff)
- type **make** (the second time will simulate and fit the model)
